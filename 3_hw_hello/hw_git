The EU will as of now be able to address a variety of hybrid threats, such as: 
the undermining electoral processes and the functioning of democratic institutions; 
threats against and sabotage of economic activities, 
services of public interest or critical infrastructure; 
the use of coordinated disinformation, foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI);
malicious cyber activities, the instrumentalisation of migrants, and other destabilizing activities.
Today’s decision, based on a proposal by the High Representative for 
Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, is part of the EU’s 
response to the continued campaign of hybrid activities by Russia, 
which has recently increased through new operations on European soil
