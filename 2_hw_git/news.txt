China views Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually come under Beijing’s control, 
and there are fears it will eventually try to annex the island by force.
Taiwan, which has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China, sees itself as distinct 
and has its own constitution and democratically elected leaders, 
and has grown increasingly opposed to China’s claims of sovereignty over it. 
In the presidential election last January voters elected Lai, who has pledged to uphold Taiwan’s self-governing status.
In their approach to China, Labour ministers have argued that they want to collaborate with Beijing on areas including trade and climate change 
while remaining clear-eyed on the security threat and human rights concerns.
In its manifesto, Labour pledged to conduct a Whitehall audit of the UK-China relationship, which is under way. 
In the past Lammy has also committed to taking steps to recognise China’s treatment of its Uyghur minority as genocide.
